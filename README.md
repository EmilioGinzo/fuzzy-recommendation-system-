# Project Name: Fuzzy Recommendation System
## Overview
This project, titled "Fuzzy Recommendation System," is a collaborative effort undertaken as part of a university initiative. The primary objective is to leverage data from Amazon, employ data analysis techniques, and implement fuzzy logic to create an advanced recommendation system. The system aims to provide insightful and personalized product recommendations based on the characteristics and preferences associated with a given product.

## Project Components
### 1. Data Collection from Amazon 
The foundation of our recommendation system relies on acquiring extensive and diverse data from Amazon. This data includes product details, customer reviews, ratings, and other relevant information. Through robust data collection, we aim to build a comprehensive dataset that forms the basis for our subsequent analysis and recommendation algorithms. https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets/amazon_v2/ The reviews and metadata

### 2. Data Analysis Techniques
We employ sophisticated data analysis techniques to extract meaningful insights from the collected data. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and statistical analysis are applied to uncover patterns, correlations, and trends within the dataset. This analytical phase serves as a crucial step in understanding user behavior and product relationships.

### 3. Fuzzy Logic Implementation
Fuzzy logic is utilized to introduce a nuanced understanding of user preferences and product associations. By incorporating fuzzy logic principles, our recommendation system can handle imprecise or ambiguous information, providing a more accurate reflection of user preferences. This ensures that the recommendations generated are not solely based on rigid criteria but adapt to the subtle nuances of individual user preferences.

## How to Use
To deploy and utilize the Product Recommendation System, follow these steps:

Set up the data collection module to fetch product data from Amazon. Go to the link provided on point (1) and download reviews and metadata of a category.
Ensure that the data collected is stored in the designated dataset repository.

Use Jupyter Notebook and run all
